# K-Means Image Compression with React.js

![Project Image](https://github.com/anupdhoble/K-meansCustering/blob/master/Screenshot%202023-10-22%20121833.png)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means algorithm for image compression using React.js. K-Means clustering allows us to significantly reduce the number of colors in an image, leading to efficient compression while maintaining image quality.

## Key Features

- Upload an image and convert it into a pixel matrix.
- Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to select a specified number of colors.
- Create a compressed image using the selected colors.
- Compare the sizes of the original and compressed images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

## Usage

1. Run the project using `npm start`.
2. Upload an image for compression.
3. Observe the compressed image and compare sizes.
